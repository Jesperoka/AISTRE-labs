# Final lab - CS4110 Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing and Reverse Engineering (2022/23 Q3)

The subdirectories contain the files that were modified by the students, with name `XXXXXXX_modified_files` corresponding to the folder in `JavaInstrumentation/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/instrumentation/` with name `XXXXXXX`. 

The modified files are then the files in `XXXXXXX_modified_files` corresponding to the file of the same name in `JavaInstrumentation/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/instrumentation/XXXXXXX` from the course lab repository.

Instructions to run the code for each lab are also given in the `README` for each subdirectory.

The lab report is given in `aistrReport.pdf`.
