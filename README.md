# Final lab - CS4110 Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing and Reverse Engineering (2022/23 Q3)

The subdirectories contain the files that were modified by the students, with name `XXXXXXX_modified_files` corresponding to the folder in `JavaInstrumentation/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/instrumentation/` with name `XXXXXXX`. 

The modified files are then the files in `XXXXXXX_modified_files` corresponding to the file of the same name in `JavaInstrumentation/src/main/java/nl/tudelft/instrumentation/XXXXXXX` from the course lab repository.

The code is ran as described in the handed out lab github repository, with the corresponding files replaced with our files (same as for all the individual lab assignments).

The lab report is given in `finalReport.pdf`.
